# c programming algorithms
 
 task-1 to task-75 questions from https://www.w3resource.com/c-programming-exercises/basic-algo/index.php and solved by own. 

 
 task-1 : Write a C program to compute the sum of the two given integer values. If the two values are the same, then return triple their sum.

 task-2 : Write a C program to get the absolute difference between n and 51. If n is greater than 51 return triple the absolute difference.

 task-3 : Write a C program to check two given integers, and return true if one of them is 30 or if their sum is 30

 task-4 : Write a C program to check a given integer and return true if it is within 10 of 100 or 200.

 task-5 : Write a C program to check whether a given positive number is a multiple of 3 or a multiple of 7. 

 task-6 : Write a C program to check whether a given temperatures is less than 0 and the other is greater than 100.

 task-7 : Write a C program to check two given integers whether either of them is in the range 100..200 inclusive.

 task-8 : Write a C program to check whether three given integer values are in the range 20..50 inclusive. Return true if 1 or more of them are in the said range otherwise return false.

 task-9 : Write a C program to check whether two given integer values are in the range 20..50 inclusive. Return true if 1 or other is in the said range otherwise false.

 task-10 : Write a C program to check which number nearest to the value 100 among two given integers. Return 0 if the two numbers are equal.
 
 task-11 : Write a C program to check whether two given integers are in the range 40..50 inclusive, or they are both in the range 50..60 inclusive

 task-12 : Write a C program to find the larger value from two positive integer values that is in the range 20..30 inclusive, or return 0 if neither is in that range.

 task-13 : Write a C program to check if two given non-negative integers have the same last digit. Go to the editor

 task-14 : Write a C program to check whether the sequence of numbers 1, 2, 3 appears in a given array of integers somewhere.

 task-15 : Write a C program to count the number of two 5's are next to each other in an array of integers. Also count the situation where the second 5 is actually a 6

 task-16 : Write a C program to check if a triple is presents in an array of integers or not. If a value appears three times in a row in an array it is called a triple.

 task-17 : Write a C program to compute the sum of the two given integers. If the sum is in the range 10..20 inclusive return 30.

 task-18 : Write a C program that accept two integers and return true if either one is 5 or their sum or difference is 5.

 task-19 : Write a C program to to test whether a given non-negative number is a multiple of 13 or it is one more than a multiple of 13.

 task-20 : Write a C program to check whether a given non-negative number is a multiple of 3 or 7, but not both.

 task-21 : Write a C program to check whether a given number is within 2 of a multiple of 10.

 task-22 : Write a C program to compute the sum of the two given integers. If one of the given integer value is in the range 10..20 inclusive return 18.

 task-23 : Write a C program to check whether it is possible to add two integers to get the third integer from three given integers.

 task-24 : Write a C program to check whether y is greater than x, and z is greater than y from three given integers x,y,z

 task-25 : Write a C program to check whether two or more non-negative given integers have the same rightmost digit.
